**Justification**

An explanation as to why these SDG were included.

- SDG 11.6.2. records particulate matter emissions by local authority. As these are a major byproduct of fossil fuel combustion, this indicator helps to give some local context which areas are more polluting.
- SDGs 8.4.1 / 12.2.2. relate to the material footprint (raw material consumption), which is positively correlated to a country's energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. 
- SDG 7.3.1. record energy intensity, which demonstrates how efficiently the UK uses energy.
- SDGs 7.1.2 / 7.2.1 / 9.1.2. relate to energy consumption, which is directly linked to the CO2 emissions.
- SDGs 1.5.1 / 11.5.1 / 13.1.1 show the mortality rate of natural disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change. 
- SDG 6.3.2. shows the condition of freshwater ecosystems, which face potential decline or degradation in the face of climate change.
- SDG 12.5.1. records the UK recycling rate, which is an aspect of the circular economy and an attempt to reduce the overall material footprint.
- SDGs 12.1.1 / 12.7.1. detail our sustainable consumption and production (SCP) national action plans, which actively seek to reduce consumption and emissions across the UK.
- SDGs 4.7.1 / 12.8.1. describe the UK's plans to incorporate learning about sustainability and climate change into the education system. There are some slight variations by Country.
- SDG 13.2.1. covers the UK legislation and programmes relating to climate change and greenhouse gas reduction.  
- SDGs 15.1.1 / 15.2.1 / 15.4.1 / 15.4.2 detail the terrestrial protected areas in the UK. A healthy and stable terrestrial ecosystem is essential to the UK's plans for climate mitigation, and provides billions of pounds in ecosystem services every year. 
- SDGs 14.5.1 / 14.c.1 detail the marine protected areas in the UK. Maintaining a stable fish population in our native waters is important step to improving national food security and resilience.
- SDG 7.b.1 details the UK's investments in energy efficiency, which directly help to reduce emissions.
- SDGs 6.4.1 / 6.4.2 / 6.5.2 details the UK's water use efficiency and extraction rates, which may be impacted by the effects of climate change.
- SDGs 1.5.3 / 1.5.4 / 11.b.2 detail the strategies used to cope with natural disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change.  
- SDGs 11.3.1 records degraded land area in the UK. Land degradation is both an effect of a climate change and a reduction in our capability to mitigate it, as the vegetation and albedo or a surface effects its ability to absorb greenhouse gases and reflect insolation.
- SDG 12.6.1 shows the number of companies publishing sustainability reports. Efficiency improvements in industry can play a big part in reducing our overall national emissions.
- SDG 12.c.1 provides information on fossil fuel subsidies in the UK. Subsidising more polluting forms of energy generation makes it more challenging for renewable or other novel sources of energy generation to see widespread implementation.
