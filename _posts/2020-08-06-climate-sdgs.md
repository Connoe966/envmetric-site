<strong>[PREAMBLE / RELEVANCE TO OUR SITE]</strong>

e.g. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have several indicators that directly or indirectly relate to climate change...
- [Metric 4.3.1](https://norric1admin.github.io/envmetric-site/4-3-1/) is based on [SDG indicator 6.3.2](https://sdgdata.gov.uk/6-3-2/), which is available on the official UK SDG website.

<strong>[SDGS DIRECTLY RELATED]</strong>

NOTE: The list is basically complete and agreed upon.

9.4: By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities
- 9.4.1: CO2 emission per unit of value added

12.c: Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities
- 12.c.1: Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption) and as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels

13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries
- 13.1.1: Number of deaths, missing persons and persons affected by disaster per 100,000 people
- 13.1.2: Number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies
- 13.1.3: Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies
13.2: Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning
- 13.2.1: Number of countries that have communicated the establishment or operationalization of an integrated policy/strategy/plan which increases their ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production (including a national adaptation plan, nationally determined contribution, national communication, biennial update report or other)
13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning 
- 13.3.1: Number of countries that have integrated mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning into primary, secondary and tertiary curricula
- 13.3.2: Number of countries that have communicated the strengthening of institutional, systemic and individual capacity-building to implement adaptation, mitigation and technology transfer, and development actions
13.a: Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible 
- 13.a.1: Mobilized amount of United States dollars per year starting in 2020 accountable towards the $100 billion commitment
13.b: Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities  * Acknowledging that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.
- 13.b.1: Number of least developed countries and small island developing States that are receiving specialized support, and amount of support, including finance, technology and capacity-building, for mechanisms for raising capacities for effective climate change-related planning and management, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities

NOTE: The list is mostly (75%)) decided. For the sake of brevity I'm omitting it for this draft.
